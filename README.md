# trees

Well, I mean, trees are cool right? And Haskell makes everything cool, right?
So, well, yeah.

I have a vague notion of doing something with bagging and boosting. Ideas
I grok to only a foggy approximation. But, I had this twinge of insight that
I could generalize these to something other than statistics. Maybe do some
voodoo with category theory (that's a thing, right?) and statistics together?
So, well, yeah ...

Anyway, I'll at some point start implementing boosting methods. These do not,
I believe, require random numbers, which is a grand since those are a pain in
Haskell.

I may also turn this repository into a general dump for tree-related projects.
I don't know, but hay is for horses and carrots for rabbits.
